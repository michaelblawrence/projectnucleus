Project nu: is an encapsulating new couch multiplayer game built for the PC with fast-paced action in mind. They say time flies when you're having fun, well they were right and if you don't believe us, then you must not have had the pleasure of playing project nu:!
The game for a thrilling night in, those rainy days or to get the party started!

Ducking and diving through a sea of explosions, you begin in your corner and it is your mission go up against your opponents dropping bombs that will send them back to their spawn earning you points. But be careful not to get caught short! Die and you too will be reset to your spawn zone and earn your enemy a point. Cause your own death and every other player will be rewarded with a point. Be careful out there! It's high risk, high reward!

Enjoy (with up to 4 local players with connected controllers) the elimination maze that is Project nu:. Battle against your friends in the arena dropping bombs that (if you're lucky) will strike your opponents and gain you point.
Now you have a selection of weapons to dominate the scene. Try dropping a sneaky steerable bomb that will surprise even the most experienced of players and choose to ignite at the perfect moment for maximum damage! Also try igniting an idle enemy's bomb before they have a chance to set it off and reap the points of the carnage that ensues
